    <h1>Short Story</h1>
    <p>Once there was a student named Tom who loved nothing more than sleeping in and watching TV. He was smart,
         but his laziness kept him from doing anything productive.
         Every day, he would rush through his homework just to get back to lounging around.</p>

    <p> One evening, Tom had a big math test the next day, but instead of studying, he chose to watch a movie marathon.
         "I'll cram in the morning," he thought. But the next morning, his alarm went off, and he hit snooze again and again.</p>
        
    <p>When he finally woke up, he was late. He threw on some clothes and ran to school, barely making it in time for the test.
         As he sat down, he realized something awfulâ€”he didn't remember anything from the lessons.
         The problems on the test looked like they were written in another language.</p>
        
    <p>Tom's mind went blank, and no amount of guessing could save him. He handed in the test, knowing he'd probably fail.
         For the rest of the day, his stomach was in knots. When he got his test back later that week, his worst fear came true: he had scored a D.</p>
        
    <p>That evening, Tom sat alone in his room, staring at the test paper. He realized his laziness had finally caught up to him.
         From that day on, he promised himself he'd stop procrastinating and take his studies seriously. Slowly but surely,
          Tom changed his habits, learning that a little effort each day made all the difference.</p>
        
    <p>In the end, Tom didn't become a perfect student overnight,
         but he did discover that hard work felt a lot better than the panic of unpreparedness.</p>
